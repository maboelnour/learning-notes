Summarize the `Cloud Architecture Patterns` with external resources.

## Chapter 1: Scalability Primer

• To vertically scale up is to increase overall application capacity by increasing the
resources within existing nodes. Scaling up is limited by the utilizable capability of available hardware.
• To horizontally scale out is to increase overall application capacity by adding nodes.
These scaling approaches are neither **mutually exclusive nor all-or-nothing**. Any application is capable of vertically scaling up, horizontally scaling out, neither, or both. For
example, parts of an application might only vertically scale up, while other parts might
also horizontally scale out.
