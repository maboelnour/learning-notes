reasons fofr distributed computing

- parallelism
- fault tolerance
- physical
- security / isolation

hard of DS is a lot of unexpected failure patterns.

challenges:
- concurrency
- partial failure
- performance 

DS infrastructure (Abstractions):
- Storage
- Communication
- Computation.

Implementation:
- RPC
- Threads
- Concurrency control

Performance:
- Scalability  

Fault Tolerance: 
- Availability: under a predefined set of failures, the service should u[ and running.
- Recoverability.


Consistency:
- put(k,v)` then `get(k)=v`
