reasons fofr distributed computing

- parallelism
- fault tolerance
- physical
- security / isolation

hard of DS is a lot of unexpected failure patterns.

challenges:
- concurrency
- partial failure
- performance 

DS infrastructure (Abstractions):
- Storage
- Communication
- Computation.

Implementation:
- RPC
- Threads
- Concurrency control

Performance:
- Scalability  

Fault Tolarance:
