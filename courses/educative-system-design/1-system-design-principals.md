 ### 1.  Requirements clarifications
dsd
### 2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation
- What scale is expected from the system?
- How much storage will we need?
- What network bandwidth usage are we expecting?

 ### 3. System interface definition
 
Define what APIs are expected from the system. This will not only establish the exact contract expected from the system but will also ensure if we havenâ€™t gotten any requirements wrong
 
 ### 4. Defining data model
 Defining the data model in the early part of the interview will clarify how data will flow between different components of the system. Later, it will guide for data partitioning and management. The candidate should be able to identify various entities of the system, how they will interact with each other, and different aspects of data management like storage, transportation, encryption, etc.
 
 6. **High-level design**
 7. **Detailed design**
 8. **Identifying and resolving bottlenecks**
 9. **Summary:**
	 In short, preparation and being organized during the interview are the keys to be successful in system design interviews. The steps mentioned above should guide you to remain on track and cover all the different aspects while designing a system.
